- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @VictorAgbaleke

I am a committed and proactive third-year University of Lethbridge student studying computer science. I have a solid background in software engineering and a thorough understanding of a variety of programming languages, including Python, Java, HTML & CSS,MySQL and C++. In addition to my academic background, I have practical experience building and running a website for Radiance Cookware, which demonstrates my ability to adapt theory to practical situations.

Apart from my technical expertise, my work in customer sales has refined my interpersonal and communication skills, enabling me to proficiently comprehend and fulfill the demands of my clients. Because of my expertise in data administration and analysis, I can also contribute to data-driven decision-making processes and glean insightful information.

I have a strong desire to use my broad skill set in a fast-paced setting, where I may develop further and add to worthwhile causes.<!---
